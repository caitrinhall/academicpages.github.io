About me
------
I'm currently a doctoral student in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychology.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. My PhD concentration is [Ecological Psychology](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/ecological-psychology/)—the study of biological perception, action, and cognition from the fundamental assumption of organism-environment mutuality. I am a graduate research assistant in the [dyscord lab](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/), advised by [Dr. Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com/). Additionally, I am a member of the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/) and the [Social-Ecological & Environmental Lab](https://seelab.socialpsych.uconn.edu/).

**Research interests**

I use nonlinear methods to study interpersonal dynamics, with an interest in group synchrony and social connectedness. My work explores how synchronizing with others impacts physiological and self-reported health outcomes in various settings. Currently, I study this in the context of yoga and mindfulness practices. As a graduate affiliate of the [Experimental Anthropology Lab](https://www.experimentalanthropology.com/), I also led a related research project in Mauritius in 2022. There, we collected self-reported and physiological data during religious rituals. Overall, I believe it is essential that I ground my scienctific questions and findings in the local community. Through my research, I aim to advocate for more widely accessible group yoga and mindfulness interventions in order to bolster social connectivity and improve wellbeing.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
