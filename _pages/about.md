About me
------
I'm currently a doctoral student in the [Department of Psychological Sciences](https://psychology.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut. My PhD concentration is [Ecological Psychology](https://psychology.uconn.edu/phd/ecological-psychology/)—the study of biological perception, action, and cognition from the fundamental assumption of organism-environment mutuality. I am a graduate research assistant in the [dyscord lab](https://dyscord-lab.github.io/), advised by [Dr. Alexandra Paxton](https://alexandrapaxton.com/). Additionally, I am a member of the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](https://cespa.uconn.edu/) and the [Social-Ecological & Environmental Lab](https://seelab.socialpsych.uconn.edu/).  

**Research Interests**  
I use nonlinear methods to study interpersonal dynamics, with an interest in group synchrony and social connectedness. My work explores how synchronizing with others impacts physiological and self-reported health outcomes in various settings.
<br/>Currently, I study this in the context of yoga and mindfulness practices. As a graduate affiliate of the [Experimental Anthropology Lab](https://www.experimentalanthropology.com/), I also led a related research project in Mauritius in 2022. There, we collected self-reported and physiological data during religious rituals.
<br/>Overall, I believe it is essential that I ground my scientific questions and findings in the local community. Through my research, I aim to advocate for more widely accessible group yoga and mindfulness interventions in order to bolster social connectivity and improve wellbeing.
